# MediaPipe Integration for Gesture Recognition

## What is MediaPipe?

MediaPipe is an open-source framework developed by Google for building cross-platform multimodal applied machine learning (ML) pipelines. It offers efficient implementations of various computer vision tasks, such as hand tracking, face detection, object detection, pose estimation, and more. MediaPipe is known for its real-time performance, scalability, and flexibility in developing high-performance applications for both desktop and mobile platforms.

It’s built on a graph-based architecture, where each node in the graph represents a computation (e.g., image processing or machine learning inference) and the edges represent data passing between nodes. This architecture allows you to build and run custom pipelines for various tasks.

## Key Features of MediaPipe
- **Cross-platform**: Works on multiple platforms such as Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.
- **Real-time performance**: Optimized for real-time computer vision and ML applications.
- **Multimodal pipelines**: Supports different types of input data such as video, images, and sensor data.
- **Modular architecture**: Pre-built modules for tasks like face detection, hand tracking, pose estimation, etc.
- **Lightweight**: Designed for low-latency, high-performance tasks on embedded systems and mobile devices.
- **Pre-built solutions**: Includes pre-trained models and customizable pipelines to help developers easily integrate AI into their applications.

## Use Cases
- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Detecting hand landmarks for controlling various applications or devices, as seen in this project for volume control.
- **Face Detection and Recognition**: Detecting faces in images or video streams for use cases like security, user interaction, or emotion detection.
- **Pose Estimation**: Tracking human body poses for fitness, sports, or gesture-based control systems.
- **Object Detection**: Identifying objects in a scene for applications like augmented reality or autonomous systems.
- **Speech and Lip-Reading**: Analyzing audio and visual data together for advanced speech recognition.

## My Projects Using MediaPipe

### 1. Volume Control Using Hand Gestures
In this project, MediaPipe’s Hand Tracking Solution is used to track hand gestures in real-time. The distance between specific hand landmarks (thumb tip and index finger tip) is used to adjust the system volume.

#### Key Features:
- **Real-time Volume Control**: By calculating the distance between the thumb and index finger, the system controls the volume, providing a hands-free way to adjust audio levels.
- **Dynamic Volume Bar**: The project displays a colorful volume bar on the screen (from pink to red), which updates in real-time based on the gesture distance.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS, allowing volume control without physical interaction with the system’s audio settings.
- **Gesture Recognition**: The project uses MediaPipe’s hand landmarks to identify specific gestures that represent volume increase, decrease, or mute.

#### How it works:
- The hand is detected using MediaPipe's hand tracking model.
- The system calculates the distance between the thumb tip and index finger tip.
- Based on the distance, the system maps the distance to a volume level (0-100).
- The volume is adjusted using macOS’s system volume control, and the corresponding volume bar is displayed on the screen.

This project demonstrates how hand gestures can be effectively used to control system-level functions such as volume, providing a more intuitive and interactive user experience.

### 2. Hand Recognition for Browser Control (Open/Close Brave Browser)
In this project, MediaPipe is used to recognize hand gestures to control the Brave browser on your system. The project can detect an "open hand" gesture to open the browser and a "closed hand" gesture to close it.

#### Key Features:
- **Gesture-based Browser Control**: Uses hand gestures to open or close the Brave browser.
- **Real-time Gesture Recognition**: MediaPipe’s hand tracking solution is utilized to detect open and closed hand gestures with minimal latency.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: The solution works on macOS and other platforms where MediaPipe is supported.
- **System Integration**: Uses the system’s process management to open and close applications based on hand gestures.

#### How it works:
- The system detects whether the hand is in an "open" or "closed" gesture.
- When an open hand gesture is detected, the Brave browser is launched using the system’s process API.
- When a closed hand gesture is detected, the system checks if Brave is running and closes it if necessary.
- The system continuously tracks the hand and updates the gesture recognition in real-time.

This project showcases how MediaPipe’s hand tracking can be used for controlling external applications, offering a unique way to interact with systems using simple gestures.

## Advantages of Using MediaPipe
- **Efficiency**: MediaPipe is highly optimized for real-time performance, allowing us to use hand gestures for control without noticeable delay.
- **Ease of Use**: The framework provides easy-to-use APIs, making it simpler for developers to integrate powerful computer vision solutions into their applications.
- **Extensibility**: You can extend and modify MediaPipe’s pipelines to suit your specific project needs, allowing for custom applications.
